                <h1>Hello World !!!</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Stella Wood, although you may know me as StellaFoxxie. I'm a huge nerd with a website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site is intended as a business card of sorts. It’s something I can show to potential employers to show off what I can do. If you are a fan of my games or music, I suggest you follow me on <a href="https://stellafoxxie.itch.io">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stellafoxxie">soundcloud</a>, as that is where most of my art ends up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a potential employer then I want you to know that I am ADDICTED to problem solving. I could never work a job where messing around and learning new things wasn't a major part of my everyday workflow. I have found that I learn best on the job and on the fly. Most if not all of my skills are developed from just making things, whether that be making music, games, or even this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my biggest dreams is to be a musician and/or lead programmer on a video game development team. programming and composing music are my two favorite things! I’d also love to work in the field of web design (I made this website after all!). The programming language I’m most familiar with is JavaScript, it’s what most of the games and demos showcased run on; But I also have some experience with c++, c#, and Java; as well as game development environments such as Unity and Godot.

                    If you would like to request a resume, or to just say hi, then you can shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:stellastuffs@gmail.com">StellaStuffs@gmail.com </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’d love to hear from you!
