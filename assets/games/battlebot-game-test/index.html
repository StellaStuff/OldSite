            <p>This was an attempt at a modular loadout fighting game starring customizable robots. The idea behind the game was to be a singleplayer campaign where you would buy parts for your robot and compete in tournaments against AI opponents to earn money to buy new parts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I didnâ€™t make it very far into developing it and the only things I made was this simple demo and the animated sprite demo. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Each robot would have had a swappable drivetrain, frame, hull, weapon, and secondary weapon. Each part would have been their own JavaScript class allowing for custom scripts for every part as well as the usual required stats. This would allow a large amount of diversity in the different parts even of the same type. (example being different types of weapons)</p>

            <p>In this demo though, you can only move around with wasd and activate your weapon by clicking. Nothing else was implemented </p>
