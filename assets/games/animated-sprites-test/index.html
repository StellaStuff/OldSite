        <div id="canvas">

        </div>
        <p>This was a test of custom animated sprites in p5js, it uses a single spritesheet for each texture and flips through the different sprites to create the illusion of movement! This was originally created for a battle bots type game that I abandoned. To do it properly it really needed to be made in an actual game engine like unity or godot. I might be able to make it in p5js knowing what I do now, but back in 2020 I definitely could not. also I wouldve had to hire artists for it because the art proved a little too complex for me ðŸ˜…</p>

        <p>the spritesheets themselves look like this: <img src="tracks.png" onclick="window.open('tracks.png', '_blank');"> <img src="rusty%20track.png" onclick="window.open('rusty%20track.png', '_blank');"> (I dont have any other examples of the programmer art I made for the project sadly)</p>
