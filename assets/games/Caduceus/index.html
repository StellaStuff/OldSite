            <p>This was basically the first game ive ever fully finished. Internally its quite messy but it manages to hold itself together for the most part. WASD or arrow keys moves your character around the center and you have to dodge the walls coming at you, the walls phase through the center and come out the other side so you need to look out for that. You can press P to pause the game</p>
