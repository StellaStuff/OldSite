        <p>This was my very first gamejam game! It was made for United Game Jam 2020 with the theme "Two". My idea was to make a multiplayer snake game where you play against yourself and have to juggle two different snakes. however I dont think I gave the player enough incentive to use both snakes as you can "beat" the game without even moving the other snake.</p>
